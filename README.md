# NTUSER-UsrClass-Extractor
PowerShell script to pull NTUSER &amp; UsrClass

Pulls NTUser & UsrClass for every user and puts them in the root of a folder named as their username.

It will work on live hosts (although won't pull NTUSER for user you're logged in as), mounted images & the mounted drive letter folder within the KAPE targets folder

Mainly for quick access to the artefacts.
